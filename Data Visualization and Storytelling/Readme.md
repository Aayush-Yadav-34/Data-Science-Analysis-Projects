# 📈 Analysis: Data Visualization and Storytelling

[View the Notebook: Data Visualization and Storytelling.ipynb](./Data%20Visualization%20and%20Storytelling.ipynb)

## Project Focus
The goal of this analysis was to master data visualization techniques to effectively communicate insights using Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

* Create fundamental charts (Line, Bar, Scatter) to identify trends and patterns.
* Implement statistical visualizations (Boxplots, Histograms, Heatmaps) for distribution and correlation analysis.
* Apply "Storytelling" principles by customizing plot aesthetics, titles, labels, and annotations to make data understandable for non-technical stakeholders.

## 📝 Analysis Content Summary

The notebook covers the following key data science operations:

### Basic Plotting with Matplotlib
* **Time Series Analysis:** Visualizing trends over time using Line plots.
* **Categorical Comparison:** Comparing quantities across groups using Bar charts.
* **Relationship Analysis:** Investigating correlations between two variables using Scatter plots.
* **Customization:** Adjusting figure size, colors, markers, and adding legends/titles for clarity.

### Statistical Visualization with Seaborn
* **Distribution Analysis:** Understanding data spread and skewness using Histograms and Kernel Density Estimates (KDE).
* **Outlier Detection:** Identifying anomalies and data spread using Boxplots and Violin plots.
* **Correlation Matrices:** Visualizing variable relationships using Heatmaps to identify feature dependencies.
* **Multi-variate Analysis:** Using Pairplots and FacetGrids to visualize relationships across multiple dimensions simultaneously.
